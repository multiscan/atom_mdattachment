# mdattachment package

This package allows to drop image files into markdown documents. The file is copied into a directory and the corresponding link is added into the document.

## Configurable options

The output directory can be configured to be a folder with the same name of the markdown file (without extension), or a common folder for all files of the files in one directory.

A checkbox allows to chose if the dropped file have to be copied into its destination folder or if it can be moved therein.
